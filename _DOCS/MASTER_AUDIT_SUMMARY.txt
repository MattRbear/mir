MASTER AUDIT SUMMARY
====================
Date: 2026-01-06
Auditor: System Auditor Agent

SYSTEMS AUDITED:
1. RaveQuant (Critical Infrastructure) - *BROKEN PATHS*
2. Microstructure Engine (Logic Core)
3. Backtester (Simulation Lab)
4. Microstructure Collector (Monitoring)
5. ALPHA (Wick Scanner)

TOP ISSUES (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
1. [P0] RaveQuant Path Error: The core system is hardcoded to look for 'RaveQuant', but the folder is named 'RaveQuant - cvd...'. This breaks everything.
2. [P1] Missing Integration: The 'Institutional Gates' (Microstructure Engine) are excellent but not connected to the 'Confluence Analyzer' (RaveQuant).
3. [P1] Data Simulation Gap: The Backtester cannot read RaveQuant's data files yet.

RECOMMENDED ACTION PLAN (High ROI):
1. RENAME folder 'RaveQuant - cvd,vwap,liqyudity buckets done' -> 'RaveQuant'.
2. RUN 'run_all.bat' in RaveQuant to verify collectors start.
3. COPY 'institutional_gates.py' from Microstructure Engine into RaveQuant/Analysis.
4. UPDATE RaveQuant/Analysis/confluence_analyzer.py to use the gates as a final filter.
5. MODIFY Backtester/data_loader.py to ingest RaveQuant's JSONL files.

CONCLUSION:
You possess a Hedge Fund grade architecture (Data Vault + Institutional Logic + Simulation). It is currently fragmented and brittle. Fixing the folder name and merging the logic will result in a powerful, unified trading system.
